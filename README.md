✅ **Global State Management** – Centralized cart state across components  
✅ **Add to Cart** – Products increase quantity if already in the cart  
✅ **Remove from Cart** – Deletes items completely  
✅ **Update Quantity** – Editable item quantity via input  
✅ **Total Calculation** – Cart total auto-calculates  
✅ **Instant UI Updates** – State changes reflect immediately  
✅ **No External Libraries** – Works without Redux Toolkit or React-Redux

## 📂 File Structure

```
src/
├── store.js          # Custom Redux-like store and cart reducer
├── App.js            # Main component with Products and ShoppingCart
└── components/       # (Optional) Separate component files
```

## 💡 Explanation

This app mimics Redux functionality **without any external dependencies**.  
It uses a global store created via `createStore()` with manual `subscribe()` to React state updates.

**Key Functions:**
- `createStore()` – Initializes store and state
- `dispatch()` – Updates state via reducer
- `subscribe()` – Triggers re-renders on change
- `cartReducer()` – Handles all cart operations
